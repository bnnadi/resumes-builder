# Job Description Analysis

## Role Classification

- Focus: (Frontend / Backend / Full-Stack / AI-ML / Infrastructure / etc.)
- Domain: (EdTech / FinTech / Healthcare / etc.)

## Key Requirements
### Required Skills (Must Have)
- List explicitly stated requirements

### Preferred Skills (Nice to Have)
- List preferred qualifications

### Experience Requirements
- Years required
- Specific technologies
- Domain experience

## Keyword Extraction

### Present Keywords
Keywords that ARE explicitly in the base resume Core Skills section:
- (List only if already present)

### Missing Keywords  
Keywords from JD that are NOT in the base resume Core Skills section:
- (Mark as gaps - do NOT add these to resume)

### Skills from Your Inventory (Available to Add)
{suggested_skills}

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SKILL ENHANCEMENT:
- The skills above are from your verified skills inventory
- You MAY add these skills to Core Skills ONLY if you can find clear evidence in your Professional Experience that you've used them
- Review each experience bullet to confirm skill usage before adding
- If uncertain or no evidence exists, do NOT add the skill - mark it as a gap instead
- Maintain complete accuracy - never add a skill without work experience proof

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONDITIONAL SKILLS:
- Some skills (like React Native, mobile development) have conditional requirements
- These should ONLY be added if BOTH conditions are met:
  1. Work experience evidence exists, AND
  2. The job explicitly requires that skill OR you managed teams using it
- Example: React Native should only be added if JD mentions "mobile development" OR you managed mobile teams
- If JD doesn't mention mobile but you built React Native apps, do NOT add - mark as gap
- Read any comments/notes in the suggested skills carefully

# Customization Strategy

## Summary Customization
### Current Summary
(Quote from base resume)

### Customized Summary
(Rewrite incorporating 2-3 JD key phrases while maintaining accuracy)

## Core Skills Enhancement
### Skills to Reorder
- Move most relevant existing skills to top
- Keep skills exactly as written in base resume
- Do NOT expand or add detail to existing skills

### Skills to Add (From Inventory)
- Review suggested skills from inventory above
- For EACH suggested skill, check if there's clear evidence in Professional Experience
- Add skill to appropriate category ONLY if proven in work history
- If no evidence, do NOT add - document as gap instead

## Experience Bullet Selection
CRITICAL: Keep resume to 1-2 pages maximum.

Target bullet counts:
- Most recent role: 4-5 bullets max
- Recent roles (last 3 years): 3-4 bullets max
- Mid-career (3-7 years ago): 2-3 bullets max
- Early career (7+ years ago): 1-2 bullets or remove

For each role, identify:
- Bullets to keep (most relevant)
- Bullets to remove (for brevity)
- Rephrasing suggestions (emphasize relevant aspects)
